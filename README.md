# SC0039_Exercise_GT
## Overview
This repository contains a script that reads a CSV file of copy number variations (CNVs) in breast cancer samples, adds a column for the length of each segment, and outputs a new file with the added `seq_length` column.
## Requirements
This script only uses the standard Python library and has no additional dependencies.
## Files
- `CSV_Assign.py`: Python script to calculate segment length.
- `brca_cnvs_tcga-1-2.csv`: Input data file with CNVs.
- `brca_cnvs_tcga_with_lengths.csv`: Output file generated by the script with the new `seq_length` column.
- ## Usage
1. Place the input file `brca_cnvs_tcga-1-2.csv` in the same directory as the script or update the `input_file` path in the script to the location of your CSV file.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python CSV_Assign.py brca_cnvs_tcga-1-2.csv
